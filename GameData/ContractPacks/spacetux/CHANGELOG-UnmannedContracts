			including New Horizons (Kerbin is a moon)
		3.  Removed AntennaRange and RemoteTech requirements.  Rather than require 
			specific antennas for missions, will now let the player decide what to do.  
			This will all the player to create satellite networks for coverage instead 
			of relying on a single powerful antenna
